Finding your sole mate is like gambling. In poker and blackjack you may have to play dozens of hands until you get a winning hand, and it is the same with relationships.</li>
                <li class="list__item list-item-light">During your life you will probably meet some people who seem like they may be the one, or that they are close, but still have the feeling that something else is missing. My advice is that if you are not happy, because something seems like it is missing, then it usually is not right.</li>
                <li class="list__item list-item-light">Before I found my special someone, I was in a relationship for over 10 years, and I thought everything was great, until I started to seriously consider getting married. Then I noticed that we had so little in common and in reality wanted so many different things out of life and one day we both realized there was much about each of us that we both wanted from someone, but it was not us that we wanted.</li>

                <li class="list__item list-item-light">Having a baby can be a nerve wracking experience for new parents – not the nine months of pregnancy, I’m talking about after the infant is brought home from the hospital. It’s always the same thing, by the time they have their third child they have it all figured out, but with number one it’s a learning thing.</li>
                <li class="list__item list-item-light">Baby monitors help you hear your baby’s needs without you having to be in the room with the baby. Some baby monitors are portable, or “mobile” and are small enough that you can carry it in your pocket as you do your daily chores around the house. Depending on your price range it’s best to have a base unit that plugs into the wall. The receiving unit can be like your portable phone, you can carry it around with you, and plug it back into the base unit to be recharged.</li>
                <li class="list__item list-item-light">Some people find that their baby monitor can be interrupted by cell phones, mobile phones, computer networks and even your neighbors baby monitors. Be aware of any potential interruptions before you put the monitor into official use. Also, make sure you get a monitor with a receiving unit that emits a tone when the battery is going low so you won’t be caught with a dead battery.</li>

              <p class="info__text">LCD screens are uniquely modern in style, and the liquid crystals that make them work have allowed humanity to create slimmer, more portable technology than we’ve ever had access to before. From your wrist watch to your laptop, a lot of the on the go electronics that we tote from place to place are only possible because of their thin, light LCD display screens. Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology still has some stumbling blocks in its path that can make it unreliable at times, but on the whole the invention of the LCD screen has allowed great leaps forward in global technological progress.</p>

              <p class="info__text">As soon as Computerized Tomography or CT scans became accessible in the 1970s, they reformed the practice of neurology. They did the scans by transmitting x-ray streams all the way through the head at different positions and accumulating the x-ray streams on the other side that was not absorbed by the head. A sequence of images come into view on a computer monitor or on an x-ray plate as if the head had been sliced from side to side by a huge salami cutter and the slices were arranged out horizontally and in series.</p>
